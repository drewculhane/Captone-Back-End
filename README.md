## Project Description

The Dreamway is a free resource for Night Elf Druid players of the game World of Warcraft. It comes complete with a forum for asking each other questions, a Profile setting where a user can choose an avatar, a specialization, and game server details. Aside from the forum, there also lots of resources for getting started as a night elf druid in world of warcraft, including talent trees for the druid class, an adventure guide, and more! 

## API

I have chosen Ruby on Rails as a server for API data because of how seamlessly bcrypt can digest password data. The Ruby app is actually not an api only app, it is a user auth connected to a database of posts, and comments, where all a users' are associated with herself or himself. It took a while to build out the backend. 


```
{data: {} }
```


## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

As of project week, database is already built, react skeleton mostly complete. 

MVP:
- Dashboard personalization and profile edit options. 
-Forum allows posting, editing and deleting only when logged in. 
-Dreamway Home provides basic starter information in getting started, and embedded talent trees. 
-Media Queries and style minimums that are acceptable. Commercially. Not Andrew Culhane perfectonist minmimum. Chill minimum. 

Post MVP: 
-Provide info on pre -lvl 20 class quests
-Provide several options for an avatar. 
-Sharpen up styling and media queries because you know it's never going to be "done" 


## Timelines
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Timelines. Note that MVP times INCLUDE staging time expectation. i.e. before a forum can meet its MVP, it first has to be built.
